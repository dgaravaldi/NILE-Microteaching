Which header field do you find in the http transfer? Get a screenshot of them!

The response is divided into header and body. Mark them in the screenshot.

Which of the following headers will you find in the request or the reponse:
host, content-length, Content-type, Server

There is a field for sending information about the used web server (software). Which one?

Perhaps you will find "Date" on both messages. How is it solved if the server and client isn't in the same timezone?

Pick two of the headers which could be interesting for a hacker. Why are they interesting for them?

If a site is not available or not accessible, how will the server tell this to the client?

Are there other cirumstances the server can tell the client this way?

We are talking about server client model. Where do you find it here?

*HTTP is a protocol. Do you know other protocols on ISO/OSI Layer 5-7?

*Have a look for SMTP (sending mails). On Wikipedia you find a message exchange diagram. Do you find some similiaries to HTTP?
